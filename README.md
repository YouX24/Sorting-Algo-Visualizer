# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project is a visualization of common sorting algorithms implemented in Javascript. The algorithms currently implemented include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Features
* Allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process.
* Includes popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
* Users can generate random arrays / bar charts to sort, allowing them to test the algorithms on different types of data.
* Users can adjust the speed of the sorting animation. This allows them to slow down the animation to better understand how the algorithm works or speed it up for faster results.
* The interface is simple and easy to use on how to choose an algorithm, generate data, adjust the animation speed, and start the visualization.


## Technologies Used
* React
